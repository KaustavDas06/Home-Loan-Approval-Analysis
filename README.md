# 🏠 Loan Approval Analysis – Factors Affecting Approval

A data analysis project on **Home Loan Approval** that explores applicant details to identify key factors influencing loan eligibility.  
Includes **data cleaning, handling categorical features, missing values, feature engineering, and EDA** with visualisations using Python.

## 📌 Objective
To determine the eligibility for granting home loans by analysing applicant information and identifying key features that influence home loan approvals.

## 🛠️ Tools used
- **Python**
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data manipulation & cleaning
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values by filling them with new categories and imputing numerical columns with the median
   - Converting categorical features to numerical with the help of categorical encoding
   - Converting data types as per convenience

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution plots for showing income densities, loan amount density, and other features.
   - Bar and box plots for showing the relation between loan status and other features.
   - Correlation heatmaps depicting strong relationships between features.
  
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Deriving meaningful features like **loan term per year**, **able to pay EMI**, **total income**
   - Identifying the most important features affecting loan approval
  
4. **Insights**
   - Analysed that a good credit history resulted in 79.5% of applications getting approved for home loans.
   - An individual with a poor or low credit score and history has a staggering 92% chance that their loan will get rejected
  
## 📊 Visualizations
The analysis includes:  
- Loan status distribution  
- Applicant income vs loan amount  
- Impact of credit history on approval  
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features
